# pykic
## Python scripts & functions for a professional / personnal use.

These codes are essentially build for a remote sensing application :
- Raster : raster utilities, some based on gdal/osgeo bindings (read/write, spatial processing...)
- Vector : ogr utilities, mainly based on Geopandas and gdal/osgeo (read/write, spatial processing...)
- SMAC : atmospheric correction from smac algorithm, developed from CESBIO
- Miscellaneous : generic codes to make the job easier

This repository is updated oftenly.
